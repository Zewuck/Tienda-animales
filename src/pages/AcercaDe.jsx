        <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
        <h2>The Story of Vidyard</h2>
        <p>After meeting at the University of Waterloo, co-founders Michael Litt and Devon Galloway formed an innovative video startup that would ultimately graduate from the elite Y Combinator program. Since then, Vidyard has grown to include competitive features, integrations, and thought leadership that position us as a top video business platform.</p>

        <h2>Redwoods Media Becomes Vidyard</h2>
        <p>Michael Litt and Devon Galloway found Redwoods Media, the first video production company to offer video hosting, analytics, and performance guarantees. Envisioning the future needs of customers, the potential of video, and the power of analytics, Redwoods Media later becomes Vidyard to focus exclusively on video sales and marketing technology.</p>
